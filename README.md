# Share & Save
### A Website aiming for preventing food waste for individuals
In modern society, more and more people live a solitary life; however, supermarkets' selling strategies always encorage people to buy more than they actually need. No wonder many of us may have been faced with the situation that food needs to be dumped just because we were unable to consume it before its expiration. 
That's why we come up with the website "Share & Save" and wish it can let every individual purchase just what they need instead of being forced to buy more than that and end up wasting food. :)
